  <h1>About Westward – What Even Is This Game?</h1>
  <p>Howdy, partner. Welcome to <strong>Westward</strong>, a multiplayer open-world game set during the wild and gritty days of U.S. western expansion (1803–1861).</p>

  <h2>What’s the game actually about?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Build stuff</strong> – Form towns, build communities, or start your own tribe.</li>
    <li><strong>Explore huge maps</strong> – Inspired by Yellowstone, Utah, and the American West.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose your side</strong> – Settlers or Tribal Leaders.</li>
    <li><strong>Make your own story</strong> – Be peaceful, aggressive, creative... it's your journey.</li>
    <li><strong>Mess around with friends</strong> – Or strangers. It's your call.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What’s the Cyfrex thing?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>DLC faction – cold-adapted lizard race with honor and feathers.</li>
    <li>Special tactics: hit-and-run, spiritual beliefs.</li>
    <li>You'll meet them... eventually.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why this server?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We're building Westward now. Volunteers needed!</li>
    <li>Writers, artists, devs, lore nerds – anyone cool welcome.</li>
    <li>Feedback is gold. Questions are good. Excitement is everything.</li>
